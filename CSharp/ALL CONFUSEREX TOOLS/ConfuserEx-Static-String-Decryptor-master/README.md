# ConfuserEx-Static-String-Decryptor
i made this a while ago when dealing with malware so didnt want to use codecrackers tool since it invokes and yq8 tool is really unstable so i made this 

it will decrypt strings statically from a non modded confuserex with or without cflow doesnt really matter

you have the option to invoke only then will your file be loaded with assembly.load

the code is terrible was a late night and a long time ago so could be improved alot 

if you find any bugs let me know ill try fix it 

i will also release my netguard 4.5 static tool which uses 2 parameters for string encryption just got to find the source

yq8 for his unused nopremover found on blackstorm i think
